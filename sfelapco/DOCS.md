## How to use

This add-on monitors the SFELAPCO website for generation charge updates and automatically creates Home Assistant sensors via MQTT discovery.

### Features

- üîÑ **Automatic Data Fetching**: Regularly scrapes generation charge data from the SFELAPCO website
- üìä **Historical Tracking**: Maintains a history of generation charges over time  
-  **Web Interface**: Beautiful web dashboard to view current rates and history
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Adjustable update intervals and data retention settings
- üîå **API Access**: RESTful API for integration with Home Assistant or other systems

### Web Interface

After starting the add-on, you can access the web interface in two ways:

1. **Home Assistant Ingress**: Click "OPEN WEB UI" in the add-on details for a seamless experience
2. **Direct Access**: Visit `http://homeassistant.local:8099` (or use your Home Assistant IP address)

The web interface provides:

- Current generation charge rate
- Historical data visualization
- Update status and logs
- Debug information for troubleshooting

### API Integration

The add-on exposes port 8099 and provides RESTful API endpoints for integration with Home Assistant or other systems:

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8099` (when accessed from within Home Assistant)

**Available Endpoints**:

- `/api/status` - Get current status and configuration
- `/api/history` - Get historical charge data
- `/api/update` - Manually trigger data update

### Home Assistant Integration

For Home Assistant integration, you can use the RESTful sensor platform to create sensors from the add-on's API:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    name: "SFELAPCO Generation Charge"
    resource: "http://localhost:8099/api/status"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.current_charge.rate if value_json.current_charge else 'unavailable' }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "PHP/kWh"
    device_class: monetary
    icon: "mdi:flash"
    scan_interval: 3600
    json_attributes:
      - current_charge
      - last_update
      - history_count
```

## Configuration

```yaml
update_interval: 1.0         # Update interval in days (default: 1 day)
retain_history: true         # Whether to keep historical data
max_history_days: 365        # Maximum days of history to keep
```

### Network Access

The add-on is configured with both ingress and port exposure:

- **Ingress**: Access via Home Assistant's "OPEN WEB UI" button (seamless integration)
- **Port 8099**: Direct network access for API calls from integrations
- **Security**: Only accepts connections from the Home Assistant supervisor network and localhost

This dual configuration allows:
1. User-friendly web interface access through ingress
2. API access for the custom Home Assistant integration
3. Direct API access for advanced users and external tools

### Option: `update_interval`

How often to check for new data from the SFELAPCO website.

- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `1.0`
- **Type**: Float (0.1-30.0)
- **Description**: Update interval in days. For example:
  - `1.0` = Check once per day
  - `0.5` = Check twice per day  
  - `7.0` = Check once per week

### Option: `retain_history`

Whether to keep historical data for tracking trends over time.

- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `true`
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Description**: Set to `false` to disable historical data collection and only track current rates.

### Option: `max_history_days`

Maximum number of days of historical data to keep.

- **Required**: No
- **Default**: `365`
- **Type**: Integer (1-1095)
- **Description**: Older historical data will be automatically cleaned up to keep storage usage reasonable.
